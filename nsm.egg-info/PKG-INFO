Description: # Introduction
        
        ## Neural Symbolic Machines (NSM)
        
        Neural Symbolic Machines is a framework to integrate neural networks and symbolic representations using reinforcement learning. 
        
        <div align="middle"><img src="https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines/blob/master/images/nsm.png" width="80%" ></div>
        
        
        ## Applications
        
        The framework can be used to learn semantic parsing and program synthesis from weak supervision (e.g., question-answer pairs), which is easier to collect and more flexible than full supervision (e.g., question-program pairs). Applications include virtual assistant, natural language interface to database, human-robot interaction, etc. It has been used to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00020">learn semantic parsers on Freebase<a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02322">natural language interfaces to database tables<a>. 
        
        <div align="middle"><img src="https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines/blob/master/images/ap.png" width="80%"></div>
        
        
        ## Memory Augmented Policy Optimization (MAPO)
        
        We use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02322">Memory Augmented Policy Optimization (MAPO)</a> to train NSM. It is a novel policy optimization formulation that incorporates a memory buffer of promising trajectories to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates for deterministic environments with discrete actions. We also apply systematic exploration to improve exploration and marginal likelihood constraint to accelerate and stabilize training. 
        
        <div align="middle"><img src="https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines/blob/master/images/mapo.png" width="80%"></div>
        
        ## Distributed Actor-Learner Architecture
        
        Our implementation uses a distributed actor-learner architecture that utilizes multiple CPUs and GPUs for scalable training, similar to the one introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561">the IMPALA paper from DeepMind</a>.

        # Dependencies
        
        - Python 2.7
        - TensorFlow>=1.7
        - Other required packages are summarized in `requirements.txt`.
        
        # Quick start
        
        ## Setup AWS instance
        Start a g3.8xlarge instance with “Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 10.0” image. (The experiments are conducted using this type of instance and image, you will need to adjust the configurations in scripts to run on other instances.)
        
        Open port (for example, 6000-6010) in the security group for tensorboard. Instructions:
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-tensorboard.html
        
        ssh into the instance.
        
        ## Download the data and install the dependencies 
        ```
        mkdir ~/projects
        cd ~/projects/
        git clone https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines.git 
        
        cd ~/projects/neural-symbolic-machines/
        ./aws_setup.sh
        ```
        
        ## Running experiments and monitor with tensorboard
        
        ### Start WikiTable experiment
        ```
        screen -S wtq
        source activate tensorflow_p27
        cd ~/projects/neural-symbolic-machines/table/wtq/
        ./run.sh mapo your_experiment_name
        ```
        This script trains the model for 30k steps and evaluates the checkpoint with the highest dev accuracy on the test set. It takes about 2.5 hrs to finish.
        
        All the data about this experiment will be saved in `~/projects/data/wikitable/output/your_experiment_name`, and the evaluation result would be saved in `~/projects/data/wikitable/output/eval_your_experiment_name`.
        
        You could also evaluate a trained model on the dev set or test set using
        ```
        ./eval.sh your_experiment_name dev
        
        ./eval.sh your_experiment_name test
        ```
        
        ### Start tensorboard to monitor WikiTable experiment
        ```
        screen -S tb
        source activate tensorflow_p27
        cd  ~/projects/data/wikitable/
        tensorboard --logdir=output
        ```
        To see the tensorboard, in the browser, go to 
        [your AWS public DNS]:6006
        `avg_return_1` is the main metric (accuracy). 
        
        
        ### Start WikiSQL experiment.  
        ```
        screen -S ws
        source activate tensorflow_p27
        cd ~/projects/neural-symbolic-machines/table/wikisql/
        ./run.sh mapo your_experiment_name
        ```
        This script trains the model for 15k steps and evaluates the checkpoint with the highest dev accuracy on the test set. It takes about 6.5 hrs to finish. 
        
        All the data about this experiment will be saved in `~/projects/data/wikisql/output/your_experiment_name`, and the evaluation result would be saved in `~/projects/data/wikisql/output/eval_your_experiment_name`.
        
        You could also evaluate a trained model on the dev set or test set using
        ```
        ./eval.sh your_experiment_name dev
        
        ./eval.sh your_experiment_name test
        ```
        
        ### Start tensorboard to monitor WikiSQL experiment
        ```
        screen -S tb
        source activate tensorflow_p27
        cd  ~/projects/data/wikisql/
        tensorboard --logdir=output
        ```
        To see the tensorboard, in the browser, go to 
        [your AWS public DNS]:6006
        `avg_return_1` is the main metric (accuracy). 
        
        ## Example outputs
        
        Example learning curves for WikiTable (left) and WikiSQL (right) experiments (0.9 smoothing):
